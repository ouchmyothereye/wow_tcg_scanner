""" The audio_feedback.py file focuses on providing audio feedback based on the results of card recognition. Here's a breakdown:

Imports and TODO Comments:

The pygame library is imported to handle audio playback.
There's a TODO comment suggesting enhancements to the audio feedback, such as more specific cues, different sounds for various errors, and voice feedback with card names.
Initialization and Sound Paths:

The pygame mixer, responsible for playing sounds, is initialized.
Paths to different audio feedback files are defined:
NO_MATCH_SOUND: Sound played when no match is found.
OLD_MATCH_SOUND: Sound played when a card is recognized but already exists in the log.
NEW_MATCH_SOUND: Sound played when a new card is recognized and added to the log.
Function: play_sound(sound_path):

Takes a path to an audio file as input.
Loads the audio file using pygame and plays it.
The function waits for the sound to finish before returning. """
